		<p>(I told ya&#8217;s that I wasn&#8217;t going to let this Bitch&#8217;s words slide&#8230;)</p>
<p>Here are the words of a high school kid in Oklahoma City in response to Kern&#8217;s hate diatribe:</p>
<p>&#8220;<font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>Rep Kern:</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>On April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma City a terrorist detonated a bomb that killed my mother and 167 others. 19 children died that day. Had I not had the chicken pox that day, the body count would&#8217;ve likely have included one more. Over 800 other Oklahomans were injured that day and many of those still suffer through their permanent wounds.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>That terrorist was neither a homosexual or was he involved in Islam. He was an extremist Christian forcing his views through a body count. He held his beliefs and made those who didn&#8217;t live up to them pay with their lives.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>As you were not a resident of Oklahoma on that day, it could be explained why you so carelessly chose words saying that the homosexual agenda is worst than terrorism. I can most certainly tell you through my own experience that is not true. I am sure there are many people in your voting district that laid a loved one to death after the terrorist attack on Oklahoma City. I kind of doubt you&#8217;ll find one of them that will agree with you.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>I was five years old when my mother died. I remember what a beautiful, wise, and remarkable woman she was. I miss her. Your harsh words and misguided beliefs brought me to tears, because you told me that my mother&#8217;s killer was a better person than a group of people that are seeking safety and tolerance for themselves.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>As someone left motherless and victimized by terrorists, I say to you very clearly you are absolutely wrong.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>You represent a district in Oklahoma City and you very coldly express a lack of love, sympathy or understanding for what they&#8217;ve been through. Can I ask if you might have chosen wiser words were you a real Oklahoman that was here to share the suffering with Oklahoma City? Might your heart be a bit less cold had you been around to see the small bodies of children being pulled out of rubble and carried away by weeping firemen?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>I&#8217;ve spent 12 years in Oklahoma public schools and never once have I had anyone try to force a gay agenda on me. I have seen, however, many gay students beat up and there&#8217;s never a day in school that has went by when I haven&#8217;t heard the word **** slung at someone. I&#8217;ve been called gay slurs many times and they hurt and I am not even gay so I can just imagine how a real gay person feels. You were a school teacher and you have seen those things too. How could you care so little about the suffering of some of your students?</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>Let me tell you the result of your words in my school. Every openly gay and suspected gay in the school were having to walk together Monday for protection. They looked scared. They&#8217;ve already experienced enough hate and now your words gave other students even more motivation to sneer at them and call them names. Afterall, you are a teacher and a lawmaker, many young people have taken your words to heart. That happens when you assume a role of responsibility in your community. I seriously think before this week ends that some kids here will be going home bruised and bloody because of what you said.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>I wish you could&#8217;ve met my mom. Maybe she could&#8217;ve guided you in how a real Christian should be acting and speaking.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>I have not had a mother for nearly 13 years now and wonder if there were fewer people like you around, people with more love and tolerance in their hearts instead of strife, if my mom would be here to watch me graduate from high school this spring. Now she won&#8217;t be there. So I&#8217;ll be packing my things and leaving Oklahoma to go to college elsewhere and one day be a writer and I have no intentions to ever return here. I have no doubt that people like you will incite crazy people to build more bombs and kill more people again. I don&#8217;t want to be here for that. I just can&#8217;t go through that again.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>You may just see me as a kid, but let me try to teach you something. The old saying is sticks and stones will break your bones, but words will never hurt you. Well, your words hurt me. Your words disrespected the memory of my mom. Your words can cause others to pick up sticks and stones and hurt others.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>Sincerely,</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="times new roman" color="#0000bf"><strong>Tucker&#8221;</strong></font></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s our own New Orleanian, Ellen DeGeneres, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alternet.org/blogs/video/#79613">trying to call Ms Kern</a>.</p>
<p><em>More to come&#8230; </em></p>

		<p>From Oklahoma comes yet another fucking B/S screed maligning people of the Queer tribe. From Pam&#8217;s House Blend comes a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pamshouseblend.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4711">good discussion</a> of this homophobic bitch&#8217;s viewpoint on her constituants. (and the YouTube piece&#8230; )</p>
<p><em>(And now comes my cunning plan&#8230; )</em><br />
So with this in mind the Church of Our Lady of Gentilly will now sponsor the Queer Consortium. The QC will be our infiltrative arm of the movement to totally subvert the Hyper-Conservative movement and the Religious Reich&#8217;s &#8220;Hit&#8221; Contract on America and Her peoples. The QC cannot allow domestic terrorists such as Sally Kern to destroy our Republic or the freedoms all Americans enjoy. Ridicule, rotten eggs and risque dress are our Three-Rs. There is no battleground on which we will not fight the amoebiac-minded creatures that wish to return our culture to the days of the  Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to move all of Humanity into the 21st Century C.E. from the enemy&#8217;s roots of the 10th Century B.C.E.. To help Humanity grow up and flower.<br />
Please send your contributions for this noble venture care of my <a target="_blank" href="http://gentillygirl.com">Blog</a>. This will help us provide stylish uniforms, berets, dozens of rotten eggs and the appropriate leather/metal gear our warriors will require. (And of course, a dance track.) We also desire appropriate aircraft (hot-air balloons, helicopters and planes) with which to dump the proper amount of horse dung upon our enemies as the situation requires. (This may require several thousand horses and land to allow us to be properly vigilant and drop on schedule.)<br />
<em><strong>If you value your lives, loves, fetishes and inebriants, please enlist for the Glorious War against the agents of Conservatism and Stone-Age living. Defend the Right of just being who you are and the Golden Rule. Aid us in ushering in the Age of Homo Futuris. (And have a damn good time in doing so.)</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Welcome to the New World&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>(The Church of Our Lady of Gentilly is a non-denominational Congregation devoted to all that Life can bring. Clothing is optional, but you must check your moralities at the door.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The <a target="_blank" href="http://gentillygirl.com/2008/03/09/heres-the-link-to-the-sally-kern-poop/">YouTube link</a> is here&#8230;  I&#8217;m finally placed something like this on my Blog. Color me shocked.</p>

<p>This is not the time to make comments outside of me saying that I am pleased by his statements. Doesn&#8217;t mean shit will actually happen, but at least Barack put it in print. (Like Hill could do something like this? Remember &#8220;Don&#8217;t Ask, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221;?) Obama actually mentioned Trans folks and Gender Identity&#8230;. *Damn!* Is that a Log Cabin Repug falling apart?</p>
<p>Oh yes baby&#8230; that was better than sex.</p>

	<div class="storycontent">
		<p>&#8220;You see here tonight a man named John Aravosis, a Gay man, totally <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/10/08/lgbt/index.html">divorced from Reality and History</a>,<em /> vainly trying to understand why his world is not what it is. He is confused and afraid. Past the STOP sign, next turn to the left and ahead&#8230; there stands the Trans-woman. AIYEEEE!&#8221; <strong>Welcome to the AAA Gay Zone</strong>. (Also called the Balls of Confusion.)</p>
<p>(No&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to play nice. Being PC to thine enemies is the worst form of hypocrisy and lunacy.)</p>
<p>My desire at this point in time is to go &#8220;postal&#8221; and not stop for days and days. The fight for Gender Identity has gone on for over a century and a half, and just as this recognition under law comes almost to our finger tips (yes, the Bushite&#8217;s gonna veto <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lambdalegal.org/news/pr/lambda-legals-analysis-enda.html">either version of the bill</a>), it is being yanked away by men who do not want us around.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the opener for an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/10/11/transgender/">opinion piece</a> by Susan Stryker in Salon a few days ago:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Pity poor John Aravosis, the gay rights crusader from AmericaBlog whose <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/10/08/lgbt/index.html">&#8220;How Did the T Get in LGBT?&#8221;</a> essay, in reference to the controversy over gender identity protections in the pending Employment Non-Discrimination Act, was published on Salon a few days ago.   To hear Aravosis tell it, he and multitudes of like-minded <a href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/gay_culture/">gay</a> souls have been sitting at the civil rights table for more than 30 years, waiting to be served. Now, after many years of blood, sweat, toil and tears, a feast in the form of federal protection against sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace has finally been prepared. Lips are being licked, chops smacked, saliva salivated, when &#8212; WTF!?! &#8212; a gaunt figure lurches through the door.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>It is a transgender person, cupped hands extended, begging for food. Seems somebody on the guest list &#8212; maybe a lot of somebodies &#8212; let this stranger in off the streets without consulting everyone else beforehand, claiming he-she-it-or-whatever was a relative of some sort. Suddenly, what was supposed to be a fabulous dinner party starts surreally morphing into one of those OxFam fundraisers dramatizing third-world hunger whose sole function is to make the &#8220;haves&#8221; feel guilty for the plight of the &#8220;have-nots.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Aravosis isn&#8217;t questioning the place of the T in the GLBT batting order; he&#8217;s just concerned with properly marking the distinction between &#8220;enough like me&#8221; and &#8220;too different from me&#8221; to merit inclusion in the categories with which he identifies. His position is a bit like those kerfuffled astronomers not too long ago, scratching their noggins over how to define Pluto&#8217;s place in the conceptual scheme of the solar system. Sure, we&#8217;ve been calling it a planet for a good number of years because it&#8217;s round and orbits the sun just like our Earth, but now it appears that if we keep doing so we&#8217;ll have to let a bunch of the bigger asteroids into the planet category, as well as some other weird faraway stuff we only recently learned about, which stretches the definition of &#8220;planet&#8221; into a name for things we don&#8217;t really think of as being much like good ol&#8217; Earth, so let&#8217;s just demote Pluto instead. In Aravosis&#8217; homocentric cosmology, men may not be from Mars, nor women from Venus, but transgender people are definitely from Pluto.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And this:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Transgender people have their own history of <a href="http://dir.salon.com/topics/civil_rights/">civil rights</a> activism in the United States, one that is in fact older, though smaller and less consequential, than the gay civil rights movement. In 1895, a group of self-described &#8220;androgynes&#8221; in New York organized a &#8220;little club&#8221; called the Cercle Hermaphroditos, based on their self-perceived need &#8220;to unite for defense against the world&#8217;s bitter persecution.&#8221; Half a century later, at the same time some gay and lesbian people were forming the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis, transgender people were forming the Society for Equality in Dress. When gay and lesbian people were fighting for social justice in the militant heyday of the 1960s, transgender people were conducting sit-in protests at Dewey&#8217;s lunch counter in Philadelphia, fighting in the streets with cops from hell outside Compton&#8217;s Cafeteria in San Francisco&#8217;s Tenderloin, and mixing it up at Stonewall along with lots of other folks.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Aravosis and those who agree with him think that the &#8220;trans revolution&#8221; has come from outside, or from above, the rank-and-file gay movement. No &#8212; it comes from below, and from within. The outrage that many people in the queer, trans, LGBT or whatever-you-want-to-call-it community feel over how a gender-inclusive ENDA has been torpedoed from within is directed at so-called leaders who are out of touch with social reality. It has to do with a generation of effort directed toward building an inclusive movement being pissed away by the clueless and the phobic. That&#8217;s why every single GLBT organization of any size at the national and state levels &#8212; with the sole exception of the spineless Human Rights Campaign &#8212; has unequivocally come out in support of gender protections within ENDA, and has opposed the effort to pass legislation protecting only sexual orientation.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Me and mine may be from Pluto or the Oort Cloud, but with people like the AAA Gays on this planet, I think the Oorts are wonderful, especially this time of year, but I&#8217;d rather spend my time in New Orleans.</p>

		<p>and a rabid <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1192691199231370.xml&#038;coll=1">cross-wearing and faith-based fruit bat</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The candidates also differ on gay rights, where Jindal is the only candidate who said he would not renew a 2004 executive order by Blanco barring state agencies and outside contractors from discriminating in their hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, political affiliation or disabilities.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Jindal said that although he does not believe in discrimination, he fears the executive order&#8217;s potential effect on nonprofit groups that contract with the government. Jindal said such groups should be allowed to discriminate in their hiring practices while still receiving tax dollars. </em></p>
<p><em> &#8220;I&#8217;d want to make sure we weren&#8217;t driving out faith-based providers from state government, from providing state services,&#8221; Jindal said.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Jindal, meanwhile, is the only candidate to call for the repeal of hate-crimes laws, which provide added penalties for crimes motivated by animosity toward a particular person or group based on race, age, gender, religion or sexual orientation.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And of course a statement by a spokesperson from one of Bobby&#8217;s loyal supporters showing that excessive religious self-indulgence severely lessens the mind&#8217;s capability toward rational thought:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Gene Mills, director of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lafamilyforum.org/">Family Forum</a>, said the term &#8220;sexual orientation&#8221; could be broadly construed to include pedophiles as a protected class of worker in state government. </em></p>
<p><em> &#8220;If one describes his propensity for minors as a sexual orientation and it says there should not be grounds for firing, then you arguably have a legal dilemma there,&#8221; Mills said.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Sexual orientation is defined as to which sex one is attracted to. Pedophilia refers to one who has sex with children. Almost 98% of reported cases of this sickness is attributed to adults, and most of them are bat-shit crazy religionists. The rest are just sickos.</p>
<p>Homosexuals aren&#8217;t into this type of thing&#8230; many of them have suffered during their childhoods at the hands of the creatures mentioned above. The last thing on their minds is to commit the same atrocities inflicted upon their bodies.</p>
<p>As for the Trans folk, never would that kind of desire cross our minds, but we are about gender identity and not orientation. Yet all of us are painted with a &#8220;heterosexual crime&#8221; brush wielded by the hands of morons who ARE NOT in touch with themselves, their identities or their sexualities.</p>
<p>Next thing these nut-jobs will want is to be allowed to burn witches. Oh shit! That&#8217;ll be strike three for me! Just bugger me with a telephone pole.</p>

		<p>What can I say about Decadence? It&#8217;s very large gathering of Gay folks for the last few days in August finishing off for the Labor Day Weekend here in New Orleans. I&#8217;ve attended several since I moved back home,  but this year I skipped it since the  anniversary of the Federal Flood this year ate my soul, mind and body alive. (Took an &#8220;introspectional trip instead, and didn&#8217;t leave the hovel.) Also, I know that Samhain isn&#8217;t that far away and I have one Hell-of-a-good-time for that celebration.</p>
<p>This year the Queers showed up in force and pumped $$$$$$$$$ into the City&#8217;s coffers and did that voo-doo that only they can do. It was a little more restrained this year, but damn! Hardly any of us have our many year&#8217;s long toy chests full of wigs, toys and outfits. As far as I know it was also fairly peaceful.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a pic from the T-P that I thought was really tres kewl (Can you guess what it&#8217;s about?):</p>
<p><img src="http://www.nola.com/cgi-bin/prxy/photogalleries/nph-cache.cgi/cache=3000;/nola/images/8994/03_decadence___3506724.jpg" /></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/metro/index.ssf?/base/news-23/1188799637218160.xml&#038;coll=1">Here&#8217;s the article</a>.</p>
<p>It also tickles my tush that the Black Men of Labor had a good showing for their Parade. Yesterday is just another example of how two supposedly disparate communities can live here and have a party at the same, within sighting distance and still be smiling and enjoying each other&#8217;s parties. It&#8217;s just another aspect of the special form of Magic that lives here. In most things we get along or at least let each other be when it&#8217;s party-time.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m getting ready for All Hallows Eve, and not pulling punches this year&#8230; (and no, I&#8217;m not telling about the outfit.)</p>
