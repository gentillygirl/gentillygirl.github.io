		<p>It was 1978 and I had been in San Francisco for maybe 9 months. The majority of the folks I knew were centered in the Castro District&#8230; I liked those folks. They were pretty much open, fun loving and accepting of a Navy kid from the Deep South. What went on in their bedrooms was none of my business, just as my &#8220;secret&#8221; was none of theirs. We had a neat little community going.</p>
<p>Then a crazy State Senator named Briggs came up with Prop 6- a banning of Gays and their supporters from being able to teach in Public schools. Since I was still contemplating getting a teaching degree when my enlistment was up, I knew that my being Trans would definitely rule out a chance to teach if Prop 6 passed.  That was the day I got into politics. (I had been doing community stuff for a few years, but not a campaign of this size.)</p>
<p>I handed out flyers, knocked on doors and basically became a pest in our fight to stop this evil proposition. Even got a talking-to from my C.O. regarding my efforts on the base. (Yep, couldn&#8217;t do that on Federal property, but he did agree with me.) I spent most of my free time traveling around the Bay Area to help stop this thing from passing. Many, many others were doing the same thing. It was very much a true Grassroots adventure. And we won the battle.</p>
<p>My Gentle Readers are probably looking cross-eyed at me wondering why I&#8217;m going into my ancient past. It&#8217;s because of a great piece from the HuffPo, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20081121/cm_huffpost/145288;_ylt=Ah7_lR8o8NvU7xgi2D6Po5Ks0NUE" target="_blank">&#8220;What Harvey Milk Tells Us About Proposition 8&#8243;</a>. I was one of Harvey&#8217;s troops in the battle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful essay, so go and read it please. But first, here&#8217;s a portion of Harvey&#8217;s speech on the night we drove Prop 6 down:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;..to the <span id="lw_1227321816_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">gay community</span> all over this state, my message to you is, so far a lot of people joined us and rejected Proposition 6, and we owe them something. We owe them to continue the education campaign that took place. We must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them. We must continue to speak out, and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out. As difficult as it is you must tell your immediate family, you must tell your relatives, you must tell your friends, if indeed they are your friends, you must tell your neighbors, you must tell the people you work with, you must tell the people in the stores you shop in (thunderous applause), and once they realize that we are indeed their children, that we are indeed everywhere, every myth, every lie, every innuendo will be destroyed once and for all. And once you do, you will feel so much better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That night changed my life even though it would be several years before I summoned up the courage to declare my true self to the World. To just be what the Goddess made me. Life is very good now.</p>
<p>And a sad note, three weeks later Harvey Milk was assasinated along with Mayor Moscone by Dan White.</p>
<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://gentillygirl.com/2008/03/21/senn-penn-plays-harvey-milk/" target="_blank">repercussions last March</a> concerning the murder of the community&#8217;s hero.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.transgenderdor.org/" target="_blank">Transgender Day Of Remembrance</a> throughout the World. It is the day when our community remembers those fellow travelers who were killed this last year by Transphobic people. In all cases the deaths were brutal and in most cases, the perpetrator (s)  have never been apprehended. There is no Justice for these acts of violence against people who are just finding their way in Life and living what they see as their personal reality.</p>
<p>There will be two different observances -</p>
<p><em>Will be holding a Transgender Day of Remembrance event on Thursday, November 20th at 6:30 PM. We are gathering at the LGBT Community Center (2114 Decatur Street, New Orleans, LA 70116) for a brief remembrance service and then taking a candlelight walk from the Faubourg Marigny through the French Quarter to the Jeanne d’Arc statue and back again.</em></p>
<p><em>The Big Easy Metropolitan Community Church in New Orleans will be having a Transgender Service of Remembrance on Sunday 23rd November at 5.00pm. It will have a short central ‘Requiem’ for those killed by Transphobic violence, as well as readings and prayers from ou Transgender members. The service will finish with a minutes silence and a congregational commitment to the Transgender Community in New Orleans. The address is 1333 S. Carrollton Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70118 and the website is <a href="http://www.bigeasymcc.com/">www.bigeasymcc.com</a></em></p>
<p>Please take a moment of silence on this day Gentle Readers.</p>

		<p>Fuck those Magic Underwear idiots. The LGBT community is <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GAY_MARRIAGE?SITE=TXWIC&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" target="_blank">attacking you</a>?</p>
<p>You fuckmooks, you create your own paranoias.  The &#8220;white powder&#8221; &#8220;attacks are probably from your own in a blatant attempt to poison the feelings about those who oppose your actions. Having lived in &#8220;Mormon-held territory&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t put it past you.</p>
<p>My kind don&#8217;t do that. All we wish is for folks like you to STFU and leave us alone.</p>
<p>The California Supreme Court rules that equal rights are for all under the State Constitution even if one is LGBT and you fucks from Utah (what a shithole state) pour $20M into a fight to overturn a different State Court&#8217;s verdict?  Ya&#8217;s teamed up with your enemies, the child-raping Catholic Church, in order to deny folks like me the right to the same rights you over-child bearing jerks enjoy?</p>
<p>Fuck you again.</p>
<p>You people are sick puppies.  You can have 10 wives but I can&#8217;t have my one Darling? That makes three &#8220;fuck yous&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yes we are protesting outside of your &#8220;business&#8221; centers. Yes we are marching. Yes we damn you to the depths of whatever Hell you subscribe to, but we don&#8217;t want to hurt anyone. We just want you to leave us alone. (Remember, you are freaks the Feds had to take down many years ago. Remember that one mooks?)</p>
<p>You put $20M into a campaign in another stae, along with the dress-wearing pediphile Catholic Church mooks, to remove the Constitutional Rights granted by the Constitution of California? Fuck you again.</p>
<p>Me and mine don&#8217;t take orders from Salt (kill me now) Lake City or the pedarists in the dung-hole named Rome. We are American citizens and we demand our Rights under the various State and Federal Constitutions. Our allegiance, devotion and love is to our Nation and it&#8217;s ideals, not to your fucking lies and superstitions. In other words weirdos, we ain&#8217;t cut from the same bolt of cloth you whack-jobs are.</p>
<p>We love and care for those we choose, and there isn&#8217;t any Power in Heaven or on Earth that can deny us. &#8220;All acts of Love are Holy in Mine eyes&#8221; states the Goddess. You may control your mindless congregations, but you have no power over us and our lives and loves. We are free from your mind control B/S. You have have no power over us&#8230; we have Power from within. That is what happens when you are self-actuated and not programmed.</p>
<p>All we ever wanted was our Rights and to be left alone to have our lives and loves. Now you mooks have a war on your hands, along with the blood of those of us killed by your teachings and the mental robots you have released upon Society. I know this to be true- I have been beaten almost to death by your minions.</p>
<p>When we win this case, I hope the punishment is the revocation of your tax-exempt status. Maybe even the banning of your hateful religions. I wish to see the death of your B/S worldview. I desire the expunging of your names from the rolls of those who lived in this country. None of you are Americans- you are space aliens or the subjects of the Vatican. That ain&#8217;t American citizenship as I see it.</p>
<p>And since I AM a vindictive bitch, may both of your tribes fuck off and die.</p>
<p>BTW- mooks, I was born with ALL of the boy and girl parts. That means I am more than any of you could ever be. The Goddess makes no mistakes. &#8216;Nuff said.</p>

		<p>a Black President now. World is changing. Freedom rings across the Land. All is well, except&#8230;</p>
<p>The LGBT community came out in great support of Barack Obama nation-wide, but in California the Black community, at the urging of their ministers, voted for Obama and voted down the chance for Same-Sex couples to be married. They took away that which the Supreme Court of California granted us as citizens of the State and of the Nation. My community chose wisely as per a leader, and others chose their prejudices when it came to Social policy and their filthy religion.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna tell you this now- most Black LGBT folks hang with the Whites because of their Black connections being so much enslaved to what their minister tells them. Black folks scream for tolerance and acceptance for their folk, but if one is Queer&#8230; fuck you.</p>
<p>This girl can never accept that viewpoint. I&#8217;m a colored person and I am Trans. I have fought for Racial rights for almost 4 decades. I never questioned my decision. Now I must.</p>
<p>If I support a community in America, and doing so by conviction, can I accept that community&#8217;s rejection of my folk? No Darlin&#8217;s, I can&#8217;t.Though I try to focus on many issues, my primary focus must be New Orleans and my tribe. I must grow where I&#8217;m planted. I must answer Truth to the multitude.</p>
<p>This is my life-</p>
<p>Alright, we do lie to each other (what couple doesn&#8217;t), Yes we play games just as much many of you do. We fucking live a life. And ya&#8217;s know what? It&#8217;s freakin&#8217; good. We are friends, we are lovers, and nothing on this planet can alter that. In many ways, I think our community is is more realistic than the &#8220;Straight World&#8221;.</p>
<p>And our commuinty is more unaccepting of the B/S handed out by Christian ministers. Why is it wrong to kiss my baby Good Night? Why is wrong to worry about were she is going? When I can&#8217;t catch on her cell&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick and tired of this battle. If I fight for you, then it should work in reverse. That&#8217;s called the Social Doctrine the Contract. It&#8217;s what many of us in America live by. Welcome to  America kids, my tribe just got fucked again by the Bible-thmping fuckmooks.</p>
<p>I no longer will honor my Black ancestory. I will not vote for those that harm my community. Stick your minister and crosses up your asses. There is no reason why I should care for the likes of you.</p>
<p>I am White and Black. The line is drawn- I fight for my community. Fuck you if you don&#8217;t get it. You fucks wish for a new world, ya&#8217;s better accept us. We are your best allies.</p>

		<p>Whilst the U.S. &#8220;seems&#8221; to be rivited on this whole bullshit Socialism bailout for the investment bank industry, gnashing their teeth and wringing their hands (mainly the executives and politicians who created this mess) I&#8217;m burned out on doing research on the whys, wheres, whos and the final outcome of the rush to save the rich and greedy mooks out there in money land. I&#8217;m holding out for a few days to really get into it since I need to build up my source links for the post. (Yes, I&#8217;m very anal over the situation.)</p>
<p>So Gentle Readers, I&#8217;m going to go over an unbelievable outrage being &#8220;researched&#8221; right now in our beloved neighboring Parish, lovable, fun-loving, family-values oriented Jefferson Parish&#8230; Land of David Duke and his honorable supporters. I tried to write about this last night when the story broke, but my dictum of &#8220;Read, Vomit, Delete&#8221; kept getting in the way. This hits way too close to freakin&#8217; home for me. Writing from a slow simmer sometimes works better than from a roiling boil.</p>
<p>Consider State <a href="http://house.louisiana.gov/h_reps/members.asp?ID=81" target="_blank">Rep. John LaBruzzo</a>, a fun-loving family-values sort who is so very concerned about the impact of the poor folks on State finances and he&#8217;s coming up with <a href="http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/labruzzo_sterilization_plan_fi.html" target="_blank">a solution</a>- State sponsored sterilization. (I guess this might be considered better than &#8220;Are there no workhouses? Are there no debtor&#8217;s prisons?&#8221;) No, our whimsical LaBruzzo wants to &#8220;decrease the surplus poor population&#8221; with a $1,000 bribe to undergo losing one&#8217;s ability to have children.</p>
<p>Here is his rationale for this current attempt at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics" target="_blank">Eugenics</a> Jefferson Parish style-</p>
<p><em>&#8220;LaBruzzo said he worries that people receiving government aid such as food stamps and publicly subsidized housing are reproducing at a faster rate than more affluent, better-educated people who presumably pay more tax revenue to the government. He said he is gathering statistics now.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Is this the 21st Century way of saying &#8220;We don&#8217;t want those kinds of folks around&#8221;?</p>
<p>On the other hand, he desires perks for the &#8220;right&#8221; kinds of people-</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It also could include tax incentives for college-educated, higher-income people to have more children, he said.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Like this world needs more freakin&#8217; Yuppies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little bit from the <a href="http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/UpToTheMinute.cfm?recID=20404" target="_blank">New Orleans City Business News</a>-</p>
<p>LaBruzzo- <em>&#8220;If both the welfare and Social Security system keep growing, one day we&#8217;re going to have a small minority of people working to fund and finance everybody else who isn’t working or producing,&#8221; LaBruzzo said. &#8220;Our kids, who will be working, will be the minority and any vote of theirs will be canceled out. If your livelihood is based on government handouts, why would you ever vote for somebody who is going to lower taxes? They never would. So once we reach that breaking point there&#8217;s no return.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>And from Shana Griffin, interim director of the New Orleans Women&#8217;s Health Clinic-</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If someone doesn&#8217;t have a car and needs to utilize city-assisted evacuation, that makes them a social burden? The fact that he feels so comfortable and entitled to make these statements is a reflection of our society, that we’re OK with the most vulnerable of our community being blamed for the social, economic and political crises that we’re experiencing,” Griffin said. “If we really want to improve the lives of people in our communities we would think about raising the minimum wage, holistic health care, improving labor laws, employment opportunities for all people and the educational system. </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Instead he wants to use a form of medical experimentation and forced sterilization on poor women of color, using their economic status as a way to make them more vulnerable to the offer.” </em></p>
<p>I also read an article last night where LaBruzzo is worried that because of differing birthrates between the Haves and the Have-Nots will alter voting patterns here in the Gret Stet. He was worried that his kind would lose elections. Sadly, any and all links to articles containing that admission are gone from the Web. I know I read that statement. Can we say &#8220;purge an unwanted statement&#8221;?</p>
<p>Rep. John LaBruzzo is a major fucking <strong>FUCKMOOK</strong>!</p>
<p>Now, why does this tale affect me much more than just the Racist aspect of the entire exercise? I AM a victim of Eugenics&#8230; the things medicine did to Intersexed people years ago in the name of Social stability and normalcy was horrible. We had to be corrected, and often said corrections render my tribe sterile. &#8220;Lord knows we don&#8217;t wany any of those teratologies (Medical= monsters) in our neighborhood. Think of the children!&#8221;. (Screw that shit.)</p>
<p>It has been found that my kind of body may very well have been fertile if the surgeons would have lopped the mis-formed Boy parts off and allowed me to be Female. Did the concept of Eugenics lead them to forever close the door to me reproducing? The answer is- wait for it&#8230; <strong>YES!</strong></p>
<p>So though I&#8217;ve never been on Welfare or Food Stamps (outside of the Gustav food aid), and besides my utter outrage concerning LaBruzzo&#8217;s &#8220;thoughts&#8221; on Social Engineering, I have now developed a healthy hatred towards any one, any one, who voted for this prick or David Duke in the Past. You creatures are the ones that need to face extinction, not those who just live and let live.</p>
<p>May the Goddess have mercy on your wretched, twisted souls.. I can&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>So some mother fucking cock decided to <a href="http://www.greeleytribune.com/article/20080731/NEWS/67465010" target="_blank">kill one of my little sisters</a> after, days after, he realized who he was dealing with.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a manly act, considering he had already had sex and did&#8217;nt realize who he was dealing with.  He had sex with the girl, came back two days later and then beat her to death with a fire extinguisher. Is it guilt or fucking stupidity?  (Ya&#8217;s don&#8217;t reach to the crotch and make your partner happy? &#8216;Tis a &#8220;manly&#8221; act&#8230; umph, umph, umph&#8230; I&#8217;m done.)  This prick is a pig, and he&#8217;s going to the pig pen and I pray that he enjoys his new life. (Okay bitch, here it comes!)</p>
<p>Angie is one of those who are one in one thousand births. It&#8217;s called endocrine disruption in utero. I am Intersexed&#8230; my kind, my kind is about one in every 2,500 births. She and I are as Nature made us. This isn&#8217;t a choice, it is a natural reality.  Neither one of us have/had a choice (unless it&#8217;s to deny self and live in pain), so we must be as we were created. To have a life is to accept the cards one is dealt.</p>
<p>From my point of view, one must grow where they are planted and live by that. In other words, we must be what we are. Many of our kind never make it past their 30th birthday, but those of us who accept and live with it have long and fruitful lives, unless that life is cut short by some heartless, clueless, bigoted fool or a blind society.</p>
<p>We are not a part of the polar society (if there really is one). We are part of the spectrum of Human kind. We are not yes or no, not plus or minus, not one or the other. We are just ourselves walking this green Earth, and we should not be demonized, marginalized or harmed for being what we are. We are sacred within the Lady&#8217;s eyes, and we should be respected as such. (walk a mile in my pumps Dearies) We are just like each and every one of you&#8230;  my hope is that you understand that.</p>
<p>No more Angies Darlin&#8217;s&#8230; no more. This is just one case out of hundreds.</p>
<p>There are Transvestites and others, but those of us who walk the talk and just live are real and whole. This is about our lives and realities. We harm no one and we wish to not be harmed as we do so. We are as Human as you&#8230; but we are a little different, and that ain&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s about how Nature made us all, understand?</p>
<p>Please try to learn to understand who we are and what we are not, That&#8217;s all me and mine ask.</p>

		<p>Sweet zombie Jesus! Its Friday night and our enemies <a href="http://worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=69996" target="_blank">are at again</a>.</p>
<p>What is it about these mooks that they keep demonizing my tribes?  Look bitches and cross-wearing bastards&#8230; come at me, one who has ALL the parts. Come at me, one who represents the Diety of Humanity&#8217;s earlist form of Spirituality. Come at me with your bigotry and hatred. Come and see what the Intersexed/Trans woman can serve you. Come and see what this little girl thinks about your religion&#8217;s fucking mutilation of my body for your bat-shit insane &#8220;belief&#8221; system.  Come and ask the woman that could never have children because of your &#8220;choice&#8221; about her Future.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from these congenital idiots-</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, if a &#8216;transgender man&#8217; or, say, employee at a McDonald&#8217;s believes his supposed &#8216;gender&#8217; is really a woman, so he wears a dress and high heels, he should be able to use the female restroom. That surely would do wonders for the productivity and workplace environment of female employees and customers at a small business, including all those local McDonald&#8217;s franchises!&#8221; LaBarbera said.&#8221;</p>
<p>You fucking dick, I have a uterus and ovaries.You are going to restrict my life and freedoms when I have the same parts as a woman? (That&#8217;s right, women don&#8217;t get a &#8220;choice&#8221;.  Lets just say, &#8220;Jack, you ignorant slut!&#8221;. I will not back down.</p>
<p>When the Hell will these shits understand that not everyone came out of a cookie-cutter? That Humanity encompasses a spectrum?  That many people don&#8217;t fit your unreal ideal?</p>
<p>Some research says my tribe is 1 in 4,500&#8230; other research states that we are 1 in 1,000.  I chose the latter figure and I can back that up. We exist.</p>
<p>You wish to deny or minimize my Goddess-given rights as a Human Being? Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.</p>
<p>My life has meaning and I have friends. Fuck you if I don&#8217;t fit your ignorant pre-conceived notions. (You never mattered in the first place). We have been here from the Beginning, and we shall be here to the end of Time. My friends, and my life, have meaning. We are also Sacred outside of the cross-wearers B/S. We are the ones that can cross the barriars. This is the Gift given to those who &#8220;walk between the worlds&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you have to go to your &#8220;book&#8221; to refute me, kiss my panty-clad tush. Ya&#8217;s ain&#8217;t gonna find the reference. And yes you fucks, I have studied the literature.</p>
<p>I am more than ready to handle your childish and sophmoric shit. I can tear your &#8220;book&#8221; apart in a few minutes. It ain&#8217;t rocket science.</p>
<p>Leave us alone you ignorant fools. Fuck off and die.</p>

		<p>For those of you who have been reading this Blog, this isn&#8217;t news, but newbies&#8230; I am a woman who has ALL of the girl and boy &#8220;parts&#8221;.  The oldest term was Hermaphrodite, later changed to Intersex, and now called DSD- Developemental Sex Disorder. (I&#8217;m sticking with Intersex because I don&#8217;t see my being as a disorder)</p>
<p>Life is very hard for my tribe. This article from <a href="http://www.endocrinetoday.com/view.aspx?rid=29460" target="_blank">EndocrineToday</a> spells it out correctly.</p>
