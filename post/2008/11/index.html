		<p>I pulled off Thanksgiving. Food came out great, but I had to keep going back to bed. I&#8217;m freakin&#8217; tired. Truth be told, I think I&#8217;m dying, but things are feeling better now. I&#8217;m just worn out.</p>
<p>This is not about my HIV&#8230; those little buggers always gift me with pneumonia when they are acting up. This ain&#8217;t Hep-C, I know what hepatitis feels like. It is something so simple that it is pathetic.</p>
<p>I am bleeding way too much everyday. It comes from when a &#8220;friend&#8221; drugged me and then spent 8 hours raping me (introducing me to Gay Culture) whilst chained to the floor. My bottom never really healed up. Wasn&#8217;t too bad until after the Federal Flood of New Orleans and me getting into the fray again.</p>
<p>I held out to see Betts and I back into the house. She put it together and my job was to support her and to fight for New Orleans. Once we got home I hoped to make through the Holidays which is her favorite time of the year. I enjoy the look in her eyes when I hang the lights and when we are cooking together. I love to see her in her Santa hat dancing to Christmas music. (Which I hate.)</p>
<p>Ain&#8217;t gonna happen this year. I&#8217;m going to be shipped out to Jackson or Houston to have a doc laser my butt. There will be doctors lecturing me about my health and me responding that I can handle it. Remember, they said I&#8217;d be dead in &#8217;95.  I have this thing about fucking with predictions. Losing the battle is not in my game plan. I&#8217;ve won battles and lost them&#8230; lost many friends in the course of the years and it hurts. I&#8217;m the Phouka&#8217;s own whelp and will continue to fight another day. I owe it to my friends who are long gone.</p>
<p>If this procedure is to be done, I&#8217;ll be gone for a time. I don&#8217;t have a working laptop so I&#8217;ll be out of the loop. This hurts me more than my body going crazy. The fight is what keeps me going. That is my reason for living, otherwise, the Summer Country is an enticing thought, but I&#8217;m not ready for that trip.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll make my decision in the next 48 hours. And I&#8217;ll post about it.</p>

Ray Nagin, to fire the mindless oaf he put in place to be the Superintendent of the NOPD due to missing monies and evidence from NOPD&#8217;s storage places. It was also about NOPD&#8217;s dismall performance when it comes to stopping crime in our little city.</p>

		<p>Okay, it&#8217;s Thanksgiving&#8230; I&#8217;m starting the cooking and I wind up here trying to slay the &#8220;War On Christmas&#8221; shit again.</p>
<p>The Season of Lights, the Mid-Winter Solstice belongs to many cultures. Christians don&#8217;t own it, but they think they do. My people called it Yule, and it was a time for sharing as it was the middle of the Winter and everyone shared what they had so that the tribe could survive until the Spring. Same thing holds for Eostore which is the Pagan celebration of the coming of Spring. These celebrations are ancient.</p>
<p>There is no proof that a man 2,000 years ago was born on Dec. 25th or was crucified in the Spring 30 years later. These are our celebrations and we willingly share them with others. These days belong to every one.  These celebrations date back over 10,000 years. They belong to all of Humanity and not to a few mooks with an attitude.</p>
<p>There was a t-shirt around years ago that showed a skinny monk wearing a hooded robe pulling a Western Flyer wagon filled with Yule trees, colored eggs and bunnies.  The caption read, &#8220;For the One True Religion, you sure stole a lot of our stuff&#8221;. Ain&#8217;t it the fucking truth.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Canterbury" target="_blank">Augustine</a>, who was sent to Britain in the Seventh Century issued an edict that churches were to be built upon and incorporate the stones of the Sacred centers so that the &#8220;people&#8221; would come to worship there. He also co-opted our seasonal celebrations in order to incorporate and transform what we Pagans believe into the religion of Rome. If conversion by the sword didn&#8217;t work, they would go with a psyche game.</p>
<p>Centuries later they would wind up burning the last of my tribe in an attempt to have complete control over the souls of the folk. Unfortunately for the dress-wearing pederasts in Rome, some of us survived. This I do know because I was there. Folk who just honored the Goddess and the cycles of Nature were be-headed or drowned or burned at the stake. They burned me, all for the sake of their &#8220;merciful&#8221; God.</p>
<p>So when <a href="http://www.billoreilly.com/" target="_blank">Bill O&#8217;Rielly</a> or the mook Dr. James Dobson (<a href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/" target="_blank">FoF</a>) starts their annual campaign about the &#8220;War On Christmas&#8221;,  my hackles get raised. What the fuck do these assholes know about the Spirit of the Season? Yes the time is very commercialized, but we give each other gifts. We, for at least a tiny portion of the year remember that we are a part of the Whole. We actually &#8220;feel&#8221; our connection with what is called Humanity. I have no idea what they feel.</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t think about a &#8220;baby lying in a manger&#8221;. The concept of shepards and three Wise Men don&#8217;t enter our celebrations. We drink, and eat and gift each other. Doesn&#8217;t this fit with what Jesus was about? Isn&#8217;t this what it&#8217;s all about?</p>
<p>Once a year, our annual cycle around the Sun, we are actually nice to each other. Would that everyday be Christmas.</p>
<p>So Mr. O&#8217;Rielly and Dr. Dobson, the only &#8220;War On Christmas&#8221; is the battle you and your kind wage against those of us who actually &#8220;get&#8221; the Spirit of the Season. Us real folk are going to eat, drink and be merry. And you mooks can just fuck the Hell off.</p>
<p>And now I must go to prepare a feast.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE-</strong> Forgot to include <a href="http://www.afa.net/" target="_blank">Donald Wildmon </a>as one of the insane mooks.</p>

	<div class="meta">Filed under: <a href="http://gentillygirl.com/category/aside/" title="View all posts in Aside" rel="category tag">Aside</a> &#8212;  Morwen Madrigal @ 2:09 am </div>

		<p>Yesterday I wrote <a href="http://gentillygirl.com/2008/11/22/thirty-years-ago-was-my-first-political-campaign/" target="_blank">about Harvey Milk</a> and the value of his words in reference to California&#8217;s Proposition 8 that was passed by a slim margin. Basically this was a way for the Christian Right, along with the Mormons, to skirt around a State Supreme Court ruling that the LGBT community had rights. I was remembering my efforts when we defeated Prop 6 in Cali thirty years ago.</p>
<p>Then <a href="http://noladder.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Editilla</a> left a comment on that post-</p>
<p><em>&#8220;And you were there. Why am I not surprised. I am not surprised. Goddess takes care of fools and errant troubadours thank you very much, so why not a warrior princess of the long run?</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks you so much for such a wonderful confirmation of the reality of change… it being in such short shrift these days.<br />
I mean, not just in this great post… but in you, your bad ass self.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It got me to thinking&#8230; why the Hell do I seem to be in the nexus of certain  conflicts? All I have ever wanted was peace and quiet and the ability to tend my own garden.  To just be Morwen cooking and planting things.  To just be myself.</p>
<p>I decide to come out and return to my beloved New Orleans only to have the Federal Flood wreck our home. To be in exile. To have to deal with carpetbaggers for almost three years. To help create a neighborhood association that is actually starting to assert itself. To hook up with folks that I never could have dreamed of meeting, much less becoming friends with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to credit Spirituality, but it&#8217;s more than that. I wound up in so many scenarios that no one would have envisioned for a kid from the Gulf Coast. Yes I am intelligent. Yes I&#8217;m a good researcher. Yes I have been in certain places at certain times to witness/experience many things.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t explain why this has been my reality. I never sought this.</p>
<p>Truth be known- I&#8217;d rather be digging dirt for my gardens, petting my cats, giving my Betty backrubs, cooking food for my friends rather than being the bitch I have been forced to be. I wanted to be mellow, but our current World cannot accomadate mellow folks. It requires fighters.</p>
<p>Years ago I stated that I was no longer a warrior&#8230; I just wanted to be a healer and teacher. Well that went right down the drainpipe. All I wanted was to hug my Honey, kiss my friends and shoot pool. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>It ain&#8217;t happening, and I&#8217;m not getting younger. I&#8217;m getting tired. I&#8217;m terminally ill. (Yes, I was supposed to die back in &#8217;95, but I&#8217;m a stubborn bitch) , and I have had to wear the mantle of warrior again. Things I believe in must be defended.</p>
<p>This is all about conviction of the heart. One can be anywhere and see injustice. One can always fight like Hell to correct those things. It&#8217;s about whether you actually take on the enemy. I believe in taking on the enemy.</p>
<p>I keep hearing the Byrds, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn!_Turn!_Turn!" target="_blank">&#8220;Turn, turn, turn&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Yes I am tired, but I am not dead, and yes I will continue to fight. That&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t0K9uyLEQY" target="_blank">&#8220;Conviction of the Heart&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>And I will continue. There is no other path to walk.</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>
<p>Blessed Be!</p>

		<p>The petition still moves forward in an attempt to have Mayor Nagin remove his over-educated, incompetent and incoherent Head of our Department of Sanitation for her complete inability to tell the truth about her department and her total disdain for any who question her.</p>

		<p>It was 1978 and I had been in San Francisco for maybe 9 months. The majority of the folks I knew were centered in the Castro District&#8230; I liked those folks. They were pretty much open, fun loving and accepting of a Navy kid from the Deep South. What went on in their bedrooms was none of my business, just as my &#8220;secret&#8221; was none of theirs. We had a neat little community going.</p>
<p>Then a crazy State Senator named Briggs came up with Prop 6- a banning of Gays and their supporters from being able to teach in Public schools. Since I was still contemplating getting a teaching degree when my enlistment was up, I knew that my being Trans would definitely rule out a chance to teach if Prop 6 passed.  That was the day I got into politics. (I had been doing community stuff for a few years, but not a campaign of this size.)</p>
<p>I handed out flyers, knocked on doors and basically became a pest in our fight to stop this evil proposition. Even got a talking-to from my C.O. regarding my efforts on the base. (Yep, couldn&#8217;t do that on Federal property, but he did agree with me.) I spent most of my free time traveling around the Bay Area to help stop this thing from passing. Many, many others were doing the same thing. It was very much a true Grassroots adventure. And we won the battle.</p>
<p>My Gentle Readers are probably looking cross-eyed at me wondering why I&#8217;m going into my ancient past. It&#8217;s because of a great piece from the HuffPo, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/huffpost/20081121/cm_huffpost/145288;_ylt=Ah7_lR8o8NvU7xgi2D6Po5Ks0NUE" target="_blank">&#8220;What Harvey Milk Tells Us About Proposition 8&#8243;</a>. I was one of Harvey&#8217;s troops in the battle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wonderful essay, so go and read it please. But first, here&#8217;s a portion of Harvey&#8217;s speech on the night we drove Prop 6 down:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;..to the <span id="lw_1227321816_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 0%; cursor: pointer; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;">gay community</span> all over this state, my message to you is, so far a lot of people joined us and rejected Proposition 6, and we owe them something. We owe them to continue the education campaign that took place. We must destroy the myths once and for all, shatter them. We must continue to speak out, and most importantly, most importantly, every gay person must come out. As difficult as it is you must tell your immediate family, you must tell your relatives, you must tell your friends, if indeed they are your friends, you must tell your neighbors, you must tell the people you work with, you must tell the people in the stores you shop in (thunderous applause), and once they realize that we are indeed their children, that we are indeed everywhere, every myth, every lie, every innuendo will be destroyed once and for all. And once you do, you will feel so much better.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That night changed my life even though it would be several years before I summoned up the courage to declare my true self to the World. To just be what the Goddess made me. Life is very good now.</p>
<p>And a sad note, three weeks later Harvey Milk was assasinated along with Mayor Moscone by Dan White.</p>
<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://gentillygirl.com/2008/03/21/senn-penn-plays-harvey-milk/" target="_blank">repercussions last March</a> concerning the murder of the community&#8217;s hero.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow is the <a href="http://www.transgenderdor.org/" target="_blank">Transgender Day Of Remembrance</a> throughout the World. It is the day when our community remembers those fellow travelers who were killed this last year by Transphobic people. In all cases the deaths were brutal and in most cases, the perpetrator (s)  have never been apprehended. There is no Justice for these acts of violence against people who are just finding their way in Life and living what they see as their personal reality.</p>
<p>There will be two different observances -</p>
<p><em>Will be holding a Transgender Day of Remembrance event on Thursday, November 20th at 6:30 PM. We are gathering at the LGBT Community Center (2114 Decatur Street, New Orleans, LA 70116) for a brief remembrance service and then taking a candlelight walk from the Faubourg Marigny through the French Quarter to the Jeanne d’Arc statue and back again.</em></p>
<p><em>The Big Easy Metropolitan Community Church in New Orleans will be having a Transgender Service of Remembrance on Sunday 23rd November at 5.00pm. It will have a short central ‘Requiem’ for those killed by Transphobic violence, as well as readings and prayers from ou Transgender members. The service will finish with a minutes silence and a congregational commitment to the Transgender Community in New Orleans. The address is 1333 S. Carrollton Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70118 and the website is <a href="http://www.bigeasymcc.com/">www.bigeasymcc.com</a></em></p>
<p>Please take a moment of silence on this day Gentle Readers.</p>
<p>Virgo Tex has a <a href="http://www.first-draft.com/2008/11/post-3.html" target="_blank">great post</a> on this over at First Draft</p>

		<p><a href="http://www.polimom.com/2008/11/12/playing-tag/" target="_blank">Polimom</a> started this, and hooked <a href="http://nolaslate.blogspot.com/2008/11/dont-blame-me-blame-polimom.html" target="_blank">NOLASlate</a> into the process. This not something I do, but for once (since I am always baring my soul) here goes-</p>
<p><em>1. Link to the person who tagged you.<br />
2. Post the rules on your blog.<br />
3. Write six random things about yourself.<br />
4. Tag six people at the end of your post and link to them.<br />
5. Let each person know they’ve been tagged and leave a comment on their blog.<br />
6. Let the tagger know when your entry is up.</em></p>
<p>Random things about myself-</p>
<p>1. I talk to everything- inanimate objects, fish, plants. You should see me with grocery carts.</p>
<p>2. Toys are my fav, especially when I&#8217;m in the bathtub. And no, ya&#8217;s can&#8217;t play with my submarine, it&#8217;s exploring.</p>
<p>3. I love fur-lined handcuffs and a paddle. (You get to imagine how they are used, and on whom)</p>
<p>4. A good game of billiards is orgasmic to me.</p>
<p>5. My sense of fashion is not the best with my friends. The NOLA Blogger gals have already informed me of that. (What&#8217;s wrong with white stockings?)</p>
<p>6. Being in the hot tub naked and waving at the passengers on the Sunset Limited as it goes by is fun. Having the neighbors see that might not be much fun. (especially if whipped cream is involved)</p>
<p>So now I have to tag six others&#8230; I&#8217;ll make them food since I&#8217;m doing this.</p>
